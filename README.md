What the purpose of designing is to make the history of Chinese clothing known by more people all over the world.

According to some study, the clothing shown above arose during the later stage of the Ming. In this stage, color of the clothing is not only set as yellow, what we normally see. Not only the color, but also the usage of dermatoglyphic pattern (紋樣) has changed into various. This clothing is designed based on the artifacts drawn in the picture, named "Ru Bi (入跸圖)".
